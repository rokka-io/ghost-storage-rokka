# Ghost Storage Rokka


A  [rokka](https://rokka.io/) [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) storage adapter.


## Installation

### Install from source

- Go into Ghost root directory

```bash
yarn add rokka@2
cd core/server/adapters/storage
git checkout https://github.com/rokka-io/ghost-storage-rokka.git rokka
```

### Install from Yarn

- Go into Ghost root directory
- Download the adapter:

```bash
yarn add ghost-storage-rokka
mv node_modules/ghost-storage-rokka core/server/adapters/storage
```

- Done, go configure

### Install on Docker

Here's an example of using this adapter with a containerized Ghost:

```Dockerfile
FROM ghost:3-alpine as rokka
WORKDIR $GHOST_INSTALL/current
RUN su-exec node yarn add ghost-storage-rokka

FROM ghost:3-alpine
COPY --chown=node:node --from=rokka $GHOST_INSTALL/current/node_modules $GHOST_INSTALL/current/node_modules
COPY --chown=node:node --from=rokka $GHOST_INSTALL/current/node_modules/ghost-storage-rokka $GHOST_INSTALL/current/core/server/adapters/storage/ghost-storage-rokka
RUN set -ex; \
    su-exec node ghost config storage.active ghost-storage-rokka; \
    su-exec node ghost config storage.ghost-storage-rokka.key ABCEHJFZ; \
    su-exec node ghost config storage.ghost-storage-rokka.organization yourorganization; \
```

Here, we use the Ghost CLI to set some pre-defined values.


## Configuration

Check out [configuration.json.dist](configuration.json.dist) for a complete example.

- Ensure to disable Ghost [Image Optimisation](https://ghost.org/docs/concepts/config/#image-optimisation)
- You ned to replace the `key` and `organization` with your values.

### Recommended configuration

- `defaultStack = somestack` you can define some default rokka stack for the imported images

### Using Rokka to as storage for all files
**IMPORTANT** By activating this feature, Ghost becomes only able to handle the file types that Rokka supports. Other types will result as an error when uploading.

It is possible to use Rokka as storage for Videos, audio, pdf... regarding what is supported. When defining the configuration as mentioned in the [configuration.json.dist](configuration.json.dist), the Rokka Storage adapter is only registered for images. It is possible to also activate it for `Files` and `Medias`. For this, update the configuration as follow

```json
"storage": {
    "active": "ghost-storage-rokka",
    "media": "ghost-storage-rokka",
    "files": "ghost-storage-rokka",
    [...]
}
```
This requires to create a stack for delivering source files on Rokka. In the stack options of Rokka, select the "Source File" options, or when creating through the api :

```json
"options": {
    "source_file": true
}
```

Then, the Rokka Storage Adapter have to be configured to work with this stack. For this, add the `sourceFileStack ` property in the configuration and set its value to the name of the stack you just created. The default value is `source_file`.

```json
"storage": {
    "active": "ghost-storage-rokka",
    "media": "ghost-storage-rokka",
    "files": "ghost-storage-rokka",
    "ghost-storage-rokka": {
        "key": "your_key",
        "organization": "your_org",
        "defaultStack": "your_default_stack",
        "sourceFileStack" : "your_source_file_stack"
    }
},
```

It is also possible to force some files extensions to be served only through the `sourceFileStack`. For this, in the Ghost Storage Adapter configuration, set the property `rawFileExtensions`. The value should be a string, all extensions separated by a coma (`,`), without dots. E.G. 

```json
    "rawFileExtensions": "mp3,ogg",
```

The default values are `'mp3', 'wav', 'ogg', 'm4a', 'mp4', 'webm', 'ogv'`.

## Face detection
Depending on your Rokka subscription, you may have access to the Face Detection feature. This feature has to be activated on the Rokka side. 

If this feature is available to you, you can configure the Storage Adapter to request Face Detection while uploading. 

For that, add `addFaceDetection` property to your storage adapter configuration, and set it to `true`.

```json
{
    [...]
    "ghost-storage-rokka": {
        "defaultStack": "stage_ellexx_com",
        [...]
        "addFaceDetection": true
    }
}
```

This Face Detection request is automatically disabled by the Storage Adapter when uploading Raw files.

**NOTE**: If you request Face Detection and that it is not enabled on Rokka, you may experience failing uploads. Check Ghost logs for more information. You can also set the Ghost logging level to `debug` and get more information on why uploads are failing.

## Using those images in the .hbs templates

When you use a custom storage adapter, you currently can't use the responsive image feature of Ghost for resizing 
images with eg. `{{img_url feature_image size="s"}}`, but you can do the URLs manually, eg. for delivering
retina images to retina capable screens:

```html
<img class="post-card-image"
src="https://yourorg.rokka.io/dynamic/resize-width-300-height-200-mode-fill--crop-width-300-height-200/o-af-1/-{{encode (img_url feature_image)}}-.jpg"
srcset="https://yourorg.rokka.io/dynamic/resize-width-300-height-200-mode-fill--crop-width-300-height-200/-{{encode (img_url feature_image)}}-.jpg 1x,
        https://yourorg.rokka.io/dynamic/resize-width-300-height-200-mode-fill--crop-width-300-height-200/o-af-1-dpr-2/-{{encode (img_url feature_image)}}-.jpg 2x"
alt="{{title}}"
/>
```

or if you have a stack, where you define all those operations and options 
(see also [Best practices for stack configurations](https://rokka.io/documentation/guides/best-practices-for-stack-configurations.html) for more info)
you can shorten it a lot:

```html
<img class="post-card-image"
src="https://yourorg.rokka.io/yourstack/-{{encode (img_url feature_image)}}-.jpg"
srcset="https://yourorg.rokka.io/yourstack/-{{encode (img_url feature_image)}}-.jpg 1x,
        https://yourorg.rokka.io/yourstack/o-dpr-2/-{{encode (img_url feature_image)}}-.jpg 2x"
alt="{{title}}"
/>
```

rokka is smart enough to take the actual hash from that url in `feature_image` 
and do the same internally as just sending the hash. 

If you add pictures from unsplash or Instagram and want to deliver and import them to rokka, you may 
have to add the following to your rokka settings:

```
curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.rokka.io/organizations/yourorg/options' \
--header 'Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--data-raw '{
    "remote_fullurl_allow": true,
    "remote_fullurl_whitelist": [
        "scontent\\.cdninstagram\\.com",
        "images\\.unsplash\\.com"
    ]
}' 
```

## Development

To enable debug logs, set the following environment variable:

	DEBUG=ghost:ghost:ghost-storage-rokka
